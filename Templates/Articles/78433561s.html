The Department of Mechanical Engineering at MNNIT has a rich legacy, dating back to its establishment in 1961. Over the years, it has evolved into a vibrant hub of learning, research, and innovation. Letâ€™s explore some key aspects:



Vision and Mission

Vision: The department aspires to be a center of excellence in mechanical, production, and industrial engineering education and research, benefiting society and humanity.

Mission:

Educate and develop competent human resources for industry and academia.

Foster interdisciplinary research and innovation skills among graduates.

Promote sustainable products, processes, and technologies by nurturing competent entrepreneurs.

Academic Streams

The department offers a diverse range of academic streams, allowing students to specialize in their areas of interest:



Design Engineering: Students delve into the intricacies of designing mechanical systems, exploring concepts like CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and product development.

Production & Industrial Engineering: This stream focuses on optimizing production processes, quality control, and industrial management.

Thermal Engineering: Students study heat transfer, thermodynamics, and energy systems.

Undergraduate Programs

The department offers an eight-semester (4-year) Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) program in Mechanical Engineering and Production & Industrial Engineering.

Each year, 163 students are admitted through JEE (mains) for B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, while 60 students join the Production and Industrial Engineering program.

Additionally, 15% of the intake comes through the Direct Admission to Students Abroad (DASA) scheme.

Postgraduate Programs

The department provides Master of Technology (M.Tech.) programs in various specializations:

Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing

Design Engineering

Product Design and Development

Production Engineering

Thermal Engineering

125 students (25 in each specialization) are admitted annually through CCMT (Centralized Counselling for M.Tech/M.Arch/M.Plan Admissions).

Ph.D. Program

The strength of the department lies in its Ph.D. program.

More than 130 Ph.D.s have been awarded till March 2023, and around 80 research scholars are currently pursuing their doctorates.

The department admits Ph.D. students equivalent to half the number of faculty holding Ph.D. degrees.

Faculty and Research

The department boasts a dynamic faculty of 37 members, highly qualified and experienced across various streams of mechanical engineering.

Research areas span from multibody dynamics to kinematics and dynamics of machinery.

The department actively contributes to cutting-edge research, shaping the future of mechanical engineering.
