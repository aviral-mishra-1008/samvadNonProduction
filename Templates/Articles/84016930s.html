Introduction
Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad, stands as a testament to India’s rich heritage, spirituality, and historical significance. Nestled at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati, this city weaves together tradition, progress, and enduring faith.

Etymology and Historical Significance
The name Prayagraj translates to “the king among the five prayāgas,” signifying its prominence as the most splendid confluence of sacred rivers in India.
In ancient Hindu texts, Prayagraj is revered as one of the world’s oldest cities, known as Prayāga.
During the late Vedic period, it was also called Kosambi, named by the Kuru rulers of Hastinapur who established it as their capital.

It has earned the moniker “Prime Minister Capital of India”, as seven out of fifteen Indian prime ministers hail from this district.
Modern Prayagraj
